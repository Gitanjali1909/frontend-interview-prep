## 1. What are `var`, `let`, and `const`?

**Answer:**  
- `var` â†’ function-scoped, can be re-declared & updated.  
- `let` â†’ block-scoped, can be updated but not re-declared in the same scope.  
- `const` â†’ block-scoped, cannot be updated or re-declared.

```js
var a = 10;
let b = 20;
const c = 30;
